# notebook_example
Example lab notebook using tools embedded in pyspecdata.

To make this work

1.	clone this repo 
•	open git bash and type, git clone https://github.com/jmfrancklab/notebook_example.git
2.	Download Miktex and install. 
•	Register TEXMF root directory in Miktex. To register, open Miktex. File> Switch to Miktex administrator mode> Settings> Directories. Click the + button to add directory of git\pyspecdata. 
3.	in the main directory of this repo (the notebook_example folder generated by git clone), run pdflatex_notebook_wrapper -synctex=1 notebook.tex (the command pdflatex_notebook_wrapper is supplied by pySpecData, and should be in your path if you've installed pySpecData)

pySpecData comes with embedded with the capability to run and update python environments that are embedded into latex (we haven't done a detailed comparison of this to pythontex, which might also be an alternate option -- this is based on code we've been using for a long time, and just works for us).

## Organization

It's not required for you to organize your notebook in this way, but we show a recommended structure where actual notebook info lives inside a folder organized by project.
Then, to know what happened on a given day, you can have files that are organized by date -- these are like a manual “table of contents,” and you provide references to what happened on that date.
